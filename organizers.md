            <p class="title">Lydia Chilton</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Columbia University</p>
            <p class="content">Lydia is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Columbia University. She is an early pioneer in decomposing complex tasks so that crowds and computers can solve them together. Her current research is in computational design - how computation and AI can help people with design, innovation, and creative problem-solving. Applications include: conveying a message visually for journalism and advertising, developing technology for public libraries, improving risk communication during hurricanes, and helping scientists explain their work on Twitter.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">IBM Research AI</p>
            <p class="content">Justin is a Research Staff Member and Research Manager at IBM Research in Yorktown Heights, NY. He leads the Human-AI Collaboration team, whose mission is to design, build, and rigorously investigate new forms of human-AI partnerships that enhance and extend human capabilities. He also leads the HCI research strategy within the AI organization, as well as a new project exploring enterprise use cases of generative AI technologies.</p>

            <p class="title">Mary Lou Maher</p>
            <p class="subtitle">University of North Carolina, Charlotte</p>
            <p class="content">Mary is a Professor and Director of the HCI Lab in the College of Computing and Informatics at UNC Charlotte. She has a joint appointment in the Department of Software and Information Systems and the School of Data Science. Her research in computational creativity extends genetic algorithms, analogical reasoning, and more recently deep learning models to automate the generation of creative designs and respond to the question: Can computers be creative? Her research in HCI has lead to a complementary focus in computational creativity to design and evaluate interaction models for co-creative systems and respond to the question: Can computational creativity enhance human creativity?</p>
